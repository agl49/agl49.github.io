# My new personal website
 
This is meant to be my own public piece of the web. I'll
be posting here anything I find intresting or deem worthy of 
sharing.

This was made using svelte 5.

# Default Svelte read me stuff

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
